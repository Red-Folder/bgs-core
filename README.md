# Background Service Plugin Core (bgs-core)

## Quick summary
This repository provides the core functionality for the Background Service Plugin for Cordova.  The functionality is not a complete plugin - it is intended to be extended by developers to create their own background service.

An example background service is provided in the https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-sample repository.

## Getting started
To understand how to create your own background service it is advised that you read the following articles:

* [Using the MyService Sample] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki/Using-the-MyService-Sample)
* [Build your own Background Service] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki/Build-your-own-Background-Service)
* [Build your own plugin] (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki/Build-your-own-plugin)

Further documentation can be found at https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/wiki

## Questions and Support
If you have problems, then please log an issue against the bgs-core repository (https://github.com/Red-Folder/bgs-core/issues).

As the plugin is updated (for new features or fixes) I will tweet via @FolderRed and blog http://red-folder.blogspot.co.uk/

## Older version
This version of the plugin is intended to work with Cordova 3.0.0+

The older version of the plugin is available at https://github.com/Red-Folder/Cordova-Plugin-BackgroundService.  Please note however that this older repository is unlikely to be maintained going forwards.  It is advised that you move to Cordova 3.x.x as soon as possible.

## Spread the love

If you find the Background Service Plugin useful then spread the love.

All the work I do on the Plugin is done in my spare time - time I would otherwise be spending taking my wife out for a nice meal or helping my lad find vinyl records (he's currently very much into The Smiths, Fleetwood Mac and Kate Bush).

The Plugin is free and will always remain free. I will continue to develop, maintain and distribute the Plugin under the MIT License.
